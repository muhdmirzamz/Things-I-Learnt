## Xcode as an editor

- If you drag and drop a file into Xcode, popup appears. "Copy items if needed" essentially makes your item be there in your folder.
- Folders can exist in two states. Yellow indicates the folder is actually there in your project directory while blue indicates your folder is referenced.
- ```// MARK:``` marks like a section inside xcode so it's easier to see your code as it's more organised
