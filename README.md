## Xcode as an editor
- If you drag and drop a file into Xcode, popup appears. "Copy items if needed" essentially does not reference something. So the item is there in your folder.
- Folders can exist in two states. Yellow indicates the folder is actually there in your project directory while blue indicates your folder is referenced.
